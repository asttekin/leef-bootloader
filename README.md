leef-bootloader
===============

Yet another custom bootloader firmware and PC loader for Atmega328 alike microcontrollers.

Currently the bootloader is working OK but needs some polishing in the software side for better UX.

Uses UART for PC communication but the main objective is to create bootloaders based on UDP + ENC28j60 and NRF24L01+ mediums based on this project. 

ihsan.
